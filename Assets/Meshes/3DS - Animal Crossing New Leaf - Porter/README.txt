IMPORTANT: The Animal Crossing New Leaf textures are mirrored by the engine ingame. The 3D program doesn't know, that the textures are supposed to be
mirrored, that's why the textures sometimes look messed up. There is an option almost in
every 3D program called "mirrored" or "mirror" in the texture window (mirror on x-axis or y-axis)

How to display the textures perfectly in Blender:

1. Select the mesh which texture you want to change.
2. Go to the textures window in the properties.
3. Go to "image mapping" and tick the X and Y box (or sometimes only the X or only the Y box).
You are done! That simply says the 3D program, that the texture should be mirrored.
